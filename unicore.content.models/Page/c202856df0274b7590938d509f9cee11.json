  "content": "Children are curious from the moment they are born. They want to learn about and understand their world. During the first five years of life and more even before 3 months, children\u2019s brains are growing faster than at any other time. Children\u2019s early experiences shape how their brains develop, and early learning sets the stage for school success. Hence, good early experiences help a child\u2019s brain develop well. The more work the brain does, the more it is capable of doing. When children play, their brains work hard.\r\n",
